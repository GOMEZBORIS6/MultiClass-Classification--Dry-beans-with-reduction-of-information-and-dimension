## **Overview:**

<div style='text-align: justify;'>

In this project, our goal is to predict the type of dry beans based on characteristics such as shape and structure, taking into account the market situation. The classification model was developed using a high-resolution camera to capture images of **13,611 grains** from these seven registered dry bean varieties. Bean images obtained through a computer vision system underwent segmentation and feature extraction stages, resulting in a total of **16 features**; **12 dimensions** and **4 shape** forms extracted from the grains. Various machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms were employed in this project to classify the most well-known 7 types of beans in Turkey: `Barbunya`, `Bombay`, `Cali`, `Dermason`, `Horoz`, `Seker`, and `Sira`. The classification was based solely on dimension and shape features of bean varieties, without incorporating external discriminatory features. Additionally, dimensionality reduction and non-collinearity methods were applied due to the high dimensionality of our dataset and the presence of correlated variables. The method used include is Principal Component Analysis called PCA because many variables is correlated and in our case all explanatory variables is continuous. The data are also unbalanced, especially for dry beans, where the class was 3.85%. For this reason, we implemented the **over-sampling** technique with ***SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)***. Over-sampling involves increasing the number of observations from the minority class to mitigate the imbalance. With the ***Deep learning model, 12 Machine Learning classification algorithms*** were implemented and the best model retained with the best performance on the Test data was the ***Random Forest with 91.99%***. We therefore looked at how each of our variables contributes to prediction in this model with ***Shapley Values***. Three variables have the least effect in the classification of the Random Forest model: Extent, solidity, shapeFactor2. After reimplementing the Random Forest without these variables, we obtained an accuracy of ***95.09%***.
